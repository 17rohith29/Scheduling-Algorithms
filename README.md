# Scheduling Algorithms
This is a Research Project Conducted for CMSC 351H at University of Maryland, College Park.<br>
In this research paper, we shall go over the problem of scheduling jobs that have no intrinsic weight.
We shall discuss 4(5 but two greedy algorithms are counted as the same) different algorithms to solve the problem.
The paper will go over their benefits, drawbacks, time and space complexity and when to use the algorithm.
But in short, we find that the problem can be solved optimally in O(nlogn) time.
We will also go over other similar research paper in the literature review (Prior Research on Related Algorithms).
